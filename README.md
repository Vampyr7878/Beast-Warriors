# Beast-Warriors
Unity game featuring Beast Wars Characters recreated using Lego CCBS.

A while ago I created bunch of characters inspired by various Beast Wars toys using Lego CCBS(Character and Creature Building System) using Lego Digital Designer. I based them all on one universal skeleton I called Protoform. I developped a way to import models from LDD into Unity to make a basic app you can use to browse trhough them. I decided to do more with it and use them for something more interactive like a game. I needed to make some modifications but new installation of LDD is broken so I had to use Bricklink Studio 2.0 instead. So here I develpped a different way to import Studio files by having a built in built in parts library.

This game is still an early prototype. So far it allows you to move character around the map, jump and switch wepaons. Ranged weapons have visual effects working.
